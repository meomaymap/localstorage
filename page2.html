<h1>The Storage Event 2</h1>

<p>The Storage event is triggered when there is a change in the window's storage area.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The storage event is only triggered when a window 
<strong>other than itself</strong> makes the changes.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this example, a new window is created, and the changes is done in the new window.</p>

<button onclick="changeValue()">Change a Storage Item</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
   
changeValue();
function changeValue() {
  localStorage.setItem("mytime", Date.now());
  
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
