<h1>The Storage Event 1</h1>

<p>The Storage event is triggered when there is a change in the window's storage area.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The storage event is only triggered when a window 
<strong>other than itself</strong> makes the changes.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this example, a new window is created, and the changes is done in the new window.</p>


<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
window.addEventListener("storage", myFunction);

function myFunction(event) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "A change was made in the storage area: " + localStorage.getItem("mytime");
}


</script>
</body>
